Experimentation project using Neural Networks (NN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA).
The subjects covered here are Artificial Intelligence and Automated Learning, mostly. This all being run by an enthousiast geek called Adrien Luxey.

The software shows animals, generated with a random brain, that live in a world where they have to eat fruits and kill other species.
At the end of every generation, the GA is called, and reproduces the animals based on their fitness to their world, mixing their DNA, mutating it, and hopefully creating more fit individuals.
And it does ! Darwin was right (no way ?) !

Of course, it is a work in progress, this subject being way to vast for a single person to cover it even slightly.

Hope you enjoy !

PS : For more information, go check www.luxeylab.fr (once I create it...), where I will put way more info/tutos/discussions about my project.
