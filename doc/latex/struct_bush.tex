\subsection{Detailed Description}
Structure representig a bush \-: point and size where fruits have high probabylity to appear. 

It is used to make fruits appear in a realistic way, ie in the form of bushes of different sizes all around the world. You can play around with it by changing Bushes\-Number, Bushes\-Min\-Size and Bushes\-Max\-Size in config.\-cfg
