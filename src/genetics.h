/**
 * @brief More or less static class operating the genetic algorithm on all the animal species of the EntityManager
 * 
 * I am not here to discuss the pros and cons of the different implementations of selection, rossover and mutation, however I have quite a lot to say about it.
 * Fear not, I might (someday) right some things about these (very interesting) subjects. But for that I need DATA !
 * My software doesn't provide any at the time, and every conclusion I might have made is only a result of a subjective observation. 
 * 
 * Likewise, I won't here explain the internal working of the algorithms I used. You have the code right here, and the web is full of documentation.
 * Googling "fitness-based selection", "uniform crossover" and such will teach you everything you need to know.
 * Again, I might right something about all this someday.
 * However, if you have interesting data on the different mutation operators that work fine on real values, I'm interested !
 * 
 * Sidenotes of the day :
 * - Fitness selection sucks, go rank-based ! (still need to code it, but later)
 * - Mutation deviation should be variable, but how ?

	 * We chose to mutate exactly one random gene from the DNA. It's the least expensive operation, and it's not worse than other solutions.
	 * 
	 * Using real numbers in genes, the best solution when mutating is to use a gaussian function.
	 * This way, we know that the new gene's value won't be far away from the old one.
	 * To control the amplitude of the mutation, we use the constant MutationGaussDeviation, in config.cfg.
	 * This constant is crucial. Set high, it enhances exploration of new solutions. Set low, it narrows the solutions to a local maximum.
	 * Because a high mutation breaks potentially good solutions, it would be nice to see the deviation reduce after some generations.
